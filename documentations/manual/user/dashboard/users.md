This guide explains how non-technical staff can manage member accounts from the backend UI.

1. Open **Users List**
2. Click **Add Users**
3. Fill required fields:
- `Role`
- `Username`
- `Email`
- `Password`
- `Password Confirmation`
4. Click **Create**

Expected result:

- New user appears in **Users List**

## 2) Edit User Role or Basic Info

1. In **Users List**, click **Edit**
2. Update fields such as:
- `Role`
- `Username`
- `Email`
- `Password` (only if you need reset)
3. Click **Edit** to save

Expected result:

- User account is updated immediately

## 3) View More User Details

1. Enable `Show Details` in the filter area
2. Review extra columns (API token, locale, timezone, login info)

Expected result:

- Extended account data is visible in list

## 4) Check User Credits Quickly

1. Enable `Show Credits`
2. Review credit columns in list
3. Click `+` beside a credit value if you need recharge operation

Expected result:

## 5) Remove User Account

## Troubleshooting
